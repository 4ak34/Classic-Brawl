1. Put your files in Patch/Gamefiles folder + fingerprint.json
2. Run Patch.py
3. Wait for the patching to finish. After it processes vi.csv you can close the window of GL - Patcher.exe (Do NOT CLOSE Patch.py)
4. Copy the link from Patch.py. Example: "http://192.168.0.19:8080/Patch/Patchs"
5. Open server config.json and paste the link from Patch.py in "PatchUrl": "Your_Link", and set boolean "Patch" to true
6. Restart the server and have fun!
